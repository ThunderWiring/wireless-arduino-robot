This code for the arduino robot i did a long while back.
Since i was asked about the code, i decided to share it here.

Code:
=====
The code you see has everything i used to get the robot running.
Basically, i used 2 ardunio UNO, one for the robot and the oter for the transmitter.
Therefore, there are 2 sketched(arduino source codes) which i uploaded, 
the others were used for testing purposes.
